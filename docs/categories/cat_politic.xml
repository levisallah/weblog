&lt;h2&gt;Society produces more and more Energy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Energy" class="align-center" src="https://parisni.github.io/weblog/images/gym.jpg" style="width: 75%;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human have gradualy been less and less physical: hunter/trapper, farmer,
workers and novadays digitalized works. In the meantime, it turns out food
has been more and more easy to get. We saturate of energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While sport is a fairly ealthy activity, the lost of energy is a pity. Worst,
going to the gym room does not collect that energy but in addition needs
energy to make those sport machine active. This man-power could be use for
other purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="society-produces-more-and-more-waste"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Society produces more and more Waste&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Packaging" class="align-center" src="https://parisni.github.io/weblog/images/coca.jpg" style="width: 75%;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waste appeared in the begining of 20th century. Before that, most of human
production were reused: from animal bones and skin to human feces. However
novodays, the waste is far from being a profitable industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all are aware that industry produces way too much plastic packaging. While
most people pay attention to put thoses wastes into trash, some do not. The
reasons of this lack of care of packaging is unknown and might be related to
education, mood or loss of attention. However what is clearly identified is the
reason why industry uses such amount of packaging: this ease customers
experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="eco-sport-best-of-two-worlds"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Eco-Sport: Best of Two Worlds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Echo Sport" class="align-center" src="https://parisni.github.io/weblog/images/eco-sport.png" style="width: 75%;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's say every jogger would gather every waste he finds in a plastic bag. This
would make it's practice way more fun, and also it's energy would be used
efficiently. In addition let's say people would see that jogger gather those
things, I bet a few proportion (children in particular) would adopt this
practice. Worst case, then would not be so prone to leave rubbish liying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is so many healthy sports to practice in town, forest, sea, river and so
on and each might be turned in eco-sport! I have right now no idea what
eco-friendly gesture a boxer might have...&lt;/p&gt;
