:darkest theme: simply go throught install menu from this `link <https://www.eclipse.org/community/eclipse_newsletter/2017/february/article5.php>`_ 


:emacs mode: select it as a key binding in the preferences. The good point is
               emacs shortcuts are also used in most linux terminals. The bad
               point is when managing *emacs* and *vi* is a kind of challenge
               in term of reflexes. The next step would be managing both
               *azerty* and *qwerty* keyboards.
