I have for long time being disapointed with **evince** pdf reader with it's
lack of capacity to zoom in and out. The same happened with **foxit reader**
and its lack of history management in its linux version.

Finally I discovered **mupdf**. It has a vi key biding, has a great zooming
window, allows back in the history. The only missing feature is beeing able to
follow links with keyboard as **luakit** does.
